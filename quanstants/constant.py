class Constant(Quantity):
    """A class that represents defined, named physical quantities, with a fixed value determined by experiment.

    Essentially a `Quantity` object with a symbol and/or name, and in most respects behaves identically.

    Like a `Unit`, requires either a `symbol` or a `name` to be provided. If `symbol` is not provided,
    it will be set to the value of `name`, so that all constants have a symbolic representation that is
    used in printed representations.
    `name` must contain only ASCII letters and digits, and underscores. It must in addition be a valid
    Python identifier, so it cannot start with a digit.
    `symbol` may be any Unicode string.

    Like a `Quantity`, requires either a number and unit to be provided, with an optional uncertainty,
    or a value containing all two or three.
    See the docs for `Quantity` for more details on acceptable input for these parameters.

    `add_to_namespace` specifies whether the constant should be added to `quanstants.constants` under the
    provided `name` and under any alternative names given as a list as `alt_names`.
    If `canon_symbol` is set to `True`, the constant will also be added to `quanstants.constants` under `symbol`.

    Constants possess the convenient additional method `.as_unit()`, which returns a `DerivedUnit` with
    the same symbol and value as the constant. This allows the creation of quantities like:
    `300 * (qu.MeV / qc.c.as_unit()**2)`
